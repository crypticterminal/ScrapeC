# ScrapeC
ScrapeC is a “mock” search engine, in the fact that it does a lot of what Bing, YouTube, and DuckDuckGo does, but instead of searching its own database it crawls and scrape these search engines and other websites. Along with return links, images, and videos of searches it also return PDFs, Social Media information (Facebook, Twitter, Google+), and Contact Information related to the links that it returns. On top of that ScrapeC also has the same features on a smaller scale for web addresses used as an input. Link: http://scrapec.pythonanywhere.com/
